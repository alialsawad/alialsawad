## 🏢 Work Experience

**Full Stack JavaScript Developer**, Coolshop srl (2022-Present)

- Assumed the role of primary developer on a full-stack JavaScript project, demonstrating expertise in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and CouchDB for F.G. Wilson and Sidel's new CMS web application.
- Spearheaded a critical upgrade of the existing codebase, migrating all key software packages to their latest versions to leverage improved functionality, security, and performance. This task required a keen understanding of each package’s features and how their updates would impact the overall application. 
- Facilitated a significant update to the code packages by replacing the core CMS functionality from using Formik to React Hook Form, enhancing the system's overall performance.
- Significantly improved legacy project code through strategic refactoring. Enhanced frontend using scalable and reusable component patterns and implemented the barrel architecture, focusing on component segregation to optimize individual component responsibilities.
- Redesigned the backend using event-driven design and decider patterns, ensuring compatibility with any database integration. Strengthened backend refactoring by partitioning distinct service layers, respecting the principle of Separation of Concerns, which facilitated smoother database interactions and reduced coupling between modules.
- Proactively addressed code-related issues, specifically focusing on code smell and adherence to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, incorporating Separation of Concerns for better code readability and maintainability, resulting in more efficient code.
- Demonstrated agility and adaptability by quickly learning and applying new technologies as per project needs, thereby ensuring timely delivery and high-quality implementation.
- Reconceptualized data structures within the application, replacing complex, nested structures with flat, easily accessible models, boosting system performance and development speed.

**Co-founder**, WiFit (2021 - 2022)

- Conceptualized and developed a health club aggregator and business intelligence platform, showcasing my ability to handle product development from end to end.

**Operations Manager**, Al Taraf Trading LLC. (2020 - 2022)

- Cultivated a variety of transferable skills including project management, communication, and problem-solving.
- Managed operations while self-studying programming, demonstrating exceptional time management and determination.
